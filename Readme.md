### Custom Lists

> Using a custom list is easy. Simply create a text file with one word per line, and load it into Rice Paper.

For example, let's say I wanted to rotate through the numbers 1 to 10. I would create a file called `Numbers.txt` and paste the following content:

```
一
二
三
四
五
六
七
八
九
十
```

Then all I have to do is open up Rice Paper and load `Numbers.txt` as a custom word list! 👏
