# Bug Reporting

## Creating a ticket

To create a ticket, click on the `Issues` tab above, and locate the `New Issue` button (in green). You will need a GitHub account for this.  Please fill out any relevant details, and if possible, assign a label (bug/enhancement/question). I will look at it as soon as humanly possible! Some general guidelines are found below.

### Bug tickets

Bugs can be very difficult to track down. Please use the example template below to include the following information to your ticket:

```
MacOS Version: 10.15.6

Description of Bug/Error:

Steps to Reproduce:

```

### Enhancement/New Feature

There are two separate labels for this, but the content is about the same.

**What is the difference between the two?**

- New Feature: A feature that *currently does not exist* but you would like me to implement.
- Enhancement: A feature that *already exists* but you think could be improved

**Please include as many details as possible!**

- Describe at a high level how you think your idea should/could work
- How does this feature behave?
- What visual changes does it entail?
- Please attach any relevant images
